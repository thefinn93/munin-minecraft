# CJDNS
These plugins interact with [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns). They
all need access to the cjdns admin interface, which can be granted in two ways:

### 1. Specify info in munin config
The preferred way to connect it to the cjdns admin interface is to place the
connection infomation in munin's node configuration, like so:

```
[cjdns_*]
env.cjdns_addr 127.0.0.1
env.cjdns_port 11234
env.cjdns_password super_duper_secure_password
```

The `cjdns_address` and `cjdns_port` are optional, and the values shown above
are used if not otherwise specified. `cjdns_password` is not optional.

### 2. Run the plugins as a user with a `.cjdnsadmin` file

The other, legacy method of connection involves running these plugins as a
specific user who has a `~/.cjdnsadmin` file. For this option, the config should
look something like this:

```
[cjdns_*]
user finn
env.HOME /home/finn
```

Note that it may not be necessary to specify `HOME`, but in my tests it was.

## cjdns_bandwidth
Show's each peer's bandwidth usage thanks to [this](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/pull/284).
Labels each peer based on the "user" field, if available (only available on
incoming peers), otherwise just public key. If the environmental variable NAMES is
set to a non empty string, it will use those names as well (names in this file
override "user" from cjdns):

```
env.NAMES /home/finn/cjdnsnames.json
```

and a sample file:

```json
{
        "l3f9rd1qrdjxbz0cjbjfxprxcnwt1zptdz1cctxcdgbkr510xcb0.k": "mal",
        "xltnfur6xh2n36g79y1qpht910c13sq7lb049662x7trfx3gf190.k": "florida",
        "8hgr62ylugxjyyhxkz254qtz60p781kbswmhhywtbb5rpzc5lxj0.k": "seanode"
}
```

Note that this will create one graph for every `authorizedPassword` currently in
use and every outgoing peer. If one password is used multiple times it will get one
graph. 7f3d83d is the last commit without this. If there is significant demand I'll
make this disableable.

## cjdns_nodes
Graphs the number of unique nodes in your routing table. This is a somewhat good
way to get an idea of the total size of the network.

## cjdns_peers.py
checks the number of active peers you have connected, using cjdns's
`InterfaceController_peerStats()` function.

## cjdns_peers.sh
checks the number of active peers you have connected using [cjdcmd](https://github.com/inhies/cjdcmd).
if cjdcmd is not in the path of the munin plugin, you may specify it's location
in the config:

```
[cjdns_peers]
env.CJDCMD /home/user/go/bin/cjdcmd
```

### cjdns_versions
Pings all known hosts, records their reported version numbers, and graphs the
the popularity of each version over time. Note that at this time I have been
unable to get this plugin to complete in a timely manner, and do not recommend
actually using it.
